Primary Changes Needed
1. Dashboard Restructure
Replace the current top metrics section with a simple "Business Health Check":

Create 4 traffic light indicators (green/yellow/red circles)
Cover: Revenue status, Pricing vs market, Pipeline strength, Cash flow
Each should show status + brief message ("On track", "Below market", "3 overdue")
Place this prominently at the top of the dashboard

2. Add "Daily Focus" Section
Add below the health check:

Single prominent insight box with today's most important action
Example: "Follow up with Sarah M. about bathroom project - she's worth 3x more than average"
Style with light blue background and border

3. Simplify Insight Cards
Transform the current verbose insight cards to single-sentence format:

Remove the "What This Shows" explanations and long paragraphs
Keep only: Problem/opportunity + Action + Impact
Example: "You're charging £15/hour less than competitors" + "Increase Emergency Rate to £70" + "+£850/month"
Make action buttons more prominent

4. Move Complex Charts to New "Advanced Analytics" Section
Create a new navigation item called "Advanced Analytics":

Move the scatter plot, detailed competitor charts, and resource utilization there
Keep the charts exactly as they are, just relocate them
The scatter plot can stay as the main feature in Advanced Analytics
Update navigation to include this new section

5. AI-Powered Dynamic Insights
Set up API integrations for generating the simplified insights:

Create API routes for both OpenAI (GPT-3.5-turbo) and Claude (Haiku) - use the cheaper models
The insights should be generated from the actual user data we're already tracking
Create a prompt that takes job data, customer data, and competitor data to generate 3 actionable insights
Format: Single sentence problem + specific action + financial impact
Have the system pick the 3 most relevant insights daily

6. Enhance Job Entry Form
Add a "Should I Take This Job?" feature:

As users fill out job details (revenue, hours, customer type), show real-time profitability indicator
Green checkmark: "Take it - fits your profitable job profile"
Red X: "Consider passing - below your £X/hour target"
Calculate based on their historical profitable job patterns

7. Future Features - Frontend Only (No Backend)
Add placeholder components for upcoming features:
WhatsApp Integration UI:

Create a settings card showing "Daily WhatsApp Updates"
Include description: "Get your key business insight via WhatsApp each morning"
Add disabled "Connect WhatsApp" button with "Feature coming soon" text

Photo Receipt Capture UI:

Add a card in expenses/job entry area
Dashed border upload area with camera icon
Text: "Snap a photo of your receipt - Auto-categorize expenses and track job profitability"
Disabled "Take Photo (Coming Soon)" button

8. Navigation Simplification
Update the sidebar navigation:

Dashboard (existing)
Jobs (existing)
Customers (existing)
Advanced Analytics (new - contains all the detailed charts)
Competitors (existing)
Profile (existing)

Technical Implementation Notes
API Integration Setup

Create /api/openai-insights endpoint for GPT-3.5-turbo
Create /api/claude-insights endpoint for Claude Haiku
Both should accept business data and return 3 formatted insights
Use the existing job, customer, and competitor data as input
Focus on cost-effective models since insights will be generated frequently

Design Requirements

Maintain existing brand colors: #508682 (sage green), #E8B894 (peach)
Keep all existing database schema unchanged
Preserve all current functionality - just reorganize presentation
Ensure mobile-responsive design for trades workers using phones

Data Flow

Use existing job profitability calculations for the "Should I Take This Job" feature
Pull competitor pricing data for market comparison insights
Leverage customer lifetime value calculations for relationship insights
Use seasonal job patterns for timing recommendations

Success Criteria
The enhanced dashboard should give users confidence about their business health within 30 seconds of opening the app, without requiring them to analyze charts or read lengthy explanations.
Focus on transforming data into actionable advice rather than presenting raw analytics. The app should feel like having a business advisor who watches the numbers and tells you exactly what to do next.
Keep the existing analytical depth in the Advanced Analytics section for users who want it, but make the main dashboard about peace of mind and clear direction.
